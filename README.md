# Source and Sink

Source, Sink, and Pipe are dataflow helpers which provide a structured way of
handling streaming changes to data in your application in a data structure
agnostic way, so that you can use whatever datastructures best represent your
application's data.

## Why?

These are intended to simplify management of complex dataflows underlying the
MVCs in your application.


## Documentation

There is none yet. This is an early work in progress. Documentation and
examples will develop when time allows.
